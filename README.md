# chainlit-app ðŸ¤–

Are you tired of only ever talking with humans? Would you like to meet our new robot overlords now that A.I. is a thing? Well look no further.

## Step 1

Clone this repo, like so...

```
git clone https://github.com/rmunoz33/chainlit-app.git
```

Then navigate into the repo, like so...

```
cd ./chainlit-app
```

## Step 2

Install Chainlit, like so...

```
pip3 install chainlit
```

Note: you can use regular `pip` if you like. I just prefer `pip3` since Chainlit requires Python version 3.8 or higher anyhow.

## Step 3

Create a `.env` file, and put the following in it...

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="MYAPIKEY"
```

... but, you know, replace "MYAPIKEY" with [your actual API key from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Step 4

Run the following in your command line...

```
chainlit run app.py -w
```

And that's it! You'll be chatting it up with our new robot rulers in no time.

**Â¡Viva la singularidad!**
